<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b><center>What is Simple Sentences ?</center></b><br/>
</br>
There are three main types of sentences. The first of these is called a simple sentence.</br>
•	A simple sentence has one independent clause and expresses one idea.</br>
Example:</br>
The company plans to market the product overseas.</br>
•	A simple sentence must have one subject - verb combination but the subject may be compound, ie have more than one element.</br></br>
Example:</br>
The <b>management and staff</b> were pleased to announce the results.</br></br>
•	A simple sentence can also have a compound verb construction.</br></br>
Example:</br>
They <b>worked hard and produced</b> an excellent display.</br></br>
Simple sentences can only have only one subject-verb combination and commas are not used. 
Below are some examples of the different combinations that you might find in simple sentences.</br></br>
Examples:</br>
1. The company was very successful.</br>
2. The company is profitable </br>
3. The company and its rival both offer competetive prices.</br>
4. The manager and staff negotiated and compromised succesfully.</br></br>
<center><b>Sentences: Simple, Compound, and Complex</b></center></br>
A common weakness in writing is the lack of varied sentences. 
Becoming aware of three general types of sentences--simple, compound, and complex--can help you vary the sentences in your writing.</br></br>
The most effective writing uses a variety of the sentence types explained below.</br>
<b>1. Simple Sentences</b></br>
A simple sentence has the most basic elements that make it a sentence: a subject, a verb, and a completed thought.</br></br>
Examples of simple sentences include the following:</br>
1.	Joe waited for the train.</br>
"Joe" = subject, "waited" = verb</br></br>
 
2.	The train was late.</br>
"The train" = subject, "was" = verb</br></br>
 
3.	Mary and Samantha took the bus.</br>
"Mary and Samantha" = compound subject, "took" = verb</br></br>
 
4.	I looked for Mary and Samantha at the bus station.</br>
"I" = subject, "looked" = verb</br></br>
 
5.	Mary and Samantha arrived at the bus station before noon and left on the bus before I arrived.</br>
"Mary and Samantha" = compound subject, "arrived" and "left" = compound verb  </br></br>

Tip: If you use many simple sentences in an essay, you should consider revising some of the sentences into compound or complex sentences (explained below). </br></br>
The use of compound subjects, compound verbs, prepositional phrases (such as "at the bus station"), and other elements help lengthen simple sentences, but simple sentences often are short. The use of too many simple sentences can make writing "choppy" and can prevent the writing from flowing smoothly.  
A simple sentence can also be referred to as an independent clause. It is referred to as "independent" because, while it might be part of a compound or complex sentence, it can also stand by itself as a complete sentence. </br></br>

<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b><center>What is Compound Sentences ?</center></b><br/>
</br><p align="justify">
A compound sentence is made up of at least two independent clauses and no dependent clauses. 
Do you remember what independent clauses are? They are groups of words with a subject and a verb, and they can stand alone as complete thoughts. 
When we take two or more independent clauses and join them together, we form a compound sentence. We usually connect the clauses with a comma and a coordinating conjunction, but you can also join them with a semicolon.
</p><br/><br/>
<center><b>
The ducks quacked, and the chicks peeped.
The ducks quacked; the chicks peeped.</b>
</center><br/><br/>
Did you notice how the sentences above express two main ideas? <br/>
<br/>
The word compound means that something is made up of two or more elements, so it makes sense that these sentences expresses two or more main ideas. 
<br/><br/>
Here is a sentence expressing three main ideas
<br/><br/>
<center><b>The ducks quacked, the chicks peeped, and the farmer smiled.</b></center><br/><br/>
Notice that there are three independent clauses in that example.<br/><br/>
<center><b>The ducks quacked. The chicks peeped. The farmer smiled.</b></center><br/><br/>
They could all stand alone if they wanted to, but they have decided to come together as one sentence.<br/><br/>
<b>Coordinating Conjunctions</b><br/><br/>
<center><b>Don't Get Tricked!</b></center><br/><br/>
<center><b>Cathy and Dan visited us on Thanksgiving.<br/>
We ate turkey and played games.</b></center><br/><br/>
Both of those sentences contain compound elements, but neither of them is compound. 
<br/><br/>
The first sentence contains a compound subject (Cathy, Dan), and the second sentence contains a compound predicate (ate turkey, played games). 
<br/><br/>
The structure of both of those sentences would be categorized as simple, not compound. 
<br/><br/>
You remember why, right? In order to be compound, it needs to contain two or more independent clauses.
<br/><br/>
<b> Compound Sentences</b><br/>

A compound sentence refers to a sentence made up of two independent clauses (or complete sentences) connected to one another with a coordinating conjunction. 
Coordinating conjunctions are easy to remember if you think of the words "FAN BOYS":<br/><br/>
	For<br/>
	And<br/>
	Nor<br/>
	But<br/>
	Or<br/>
	Yet<br/>
	So
<br/><br/>
Examples of compound sentences include the following:<br/>
1.	Joe waited for the train, but the train was late.<br/><br/>
 
2.	I looked for Mary and Samantha at the bus station, but they arrived at the station before noon and left on the bus before I arrived.<br/><br/>
 
3.	Mary and Samantha arrived at the bus station before noon, and they left on the bus before I arrived.<br/><br/>
 
4.	Mary and Samantha left on the bus before I arrived, so I did not see them at the bus station.<br/><br/>

<p align="justify">
Tip: If you rely heavily on compound sentences in an essay, you should consider revising some of them into complex sentences (explained below).
Coordinating conjunctions are useful for connecting sentences, but compound sentences often are overused. While coordinating conjunctions can indicate some type of relationship between the two independent clauses in the sentence, they sometimes do not indicate much of a relationship. The word "and," for example, only adds one independent clause to another, without indicating how the two parts of a sentence are logically related. Too many compound sentences that use "and" can weaken writing.
Clearer and more specific relationships can be established through the use of complex sentences.</p> <br/><br/>

<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b><center>What is Complex Sentences ?</center></b><br/>
</br>
A complex sentence has a main clause and one or more adverbial clauses. Adverbial clauses usually come after the main clause:<br/><br/>
Her father died when she was very young<br/> 
>>><br/>
Her father died (main clause) <br/>
when (subordinating conjunction) <br/>
she was very young (adverbial clause)<br/><br/>
She had a difficult childhood because her father died when she was very young.<br/> 
>>><br/>
She had a difficult childhood (main clause) <br/>
because (subordinating conjunction) <br/>
her father died (adverbial clause) <br/>
when (subordinating conjunction) <br/>
she was very young (adverbial clause).<br/><br/>

Some subordinate clauses can come in front of the main clause:
<br/><br/>
Although a few snakes are dangerous most of them are quite harmless<br/>
>>><br/>
Although (subordinating conjunction) <br/>
some snakes are dangerous (adverbial clause) <br/>
most of them are harmless (main clause).<br/><br/>

A sentence can contain both subordinate and coordinate clauses:<br/><br/>
Although she has always lived in France, she speaks fluent English because her mother was American and her father was Nigerian<br/> 
>>><br/>
Although (subordinating conjunction) <br/>
she has always lived in France (adverbial clause), <br/>
she speaks fluent English (main clause) <br/>
because (subordinating conjunction) <br/>
her mother was American (adverbial clause)<br/>
and (coordinating conjunction) <br/>
her father was Nigerian (adverbial clause).<br/><br/>

<b>Complex Sentences</b><br/>
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and one or more dependent clauses connected to it. 
A dependent clause is similar to an independent clause, or complete sentence, but it lacks one of the elements that would make it a complete sentence. <br/><br/>

Examples of dependent clauses include the following:<br/>
	because Mary and Samantha arrived at the bus station before noon<br/>
	while he waited at the train station<br/>
	after they left on the bus
<br/>

Dependent clauses such as those above cannot stand alone as a sentence, but they can be added to an independent clause to form a complex sentence.<br/>
<br/>

Dependent clauses begin with subordinating conjunctions. Below are some of the most common subordinating conjunctions:<br/>
<br/>
 
	after<br/>
	although<br/>
	as<br/>
	because<br/>
	before<br/>
	even though<br/>
	if<br/>
	since<br/>
	though<br/>
	unless<br/>
	until<br/>
	when<br/>
	whenever<br/>
	whereas<br/>
	wherever<br/>
	while<br/>

A complex sentence joins an independent clause with one or more dependent clauses.<br/>
The dependent clauses can go first in the sentence, followed by the independent clause, as in the following:<br/><br/>

Tip: When the dependent clause comes first, a comma should be used to separate the two clauses.<br/><br/>

1.	Because Mary and Samantha arrived at the bus station before noon, I did not see them at the station.<br/>
2.	While he waited at the train station, Joe realized that the train was late.<br/>
3.	After they left on the bus, Mary and Samantha realized that Joe was waiting at the train station.<br/><br/>

Conversely, the independent clauses can go first in the sentence, followed by the dependent clause, as in the following:<br/><br/>

Tip: When the independent clause comes first, a comma should not be used to separate the two clauses.<br/><br/>

1.	I did not see them at the station because Mary and Samantha arrived at the bus station before noon.<br/>
2.	Joe realized that the train was late while he waited at the train station.<br/>
3.	Mary and Samantha realized that Joe was waiting at the train station after they left on the bus.<br/><br/>

<p align="justify">Complex sentences are often more effective than compound sentences because a complex sentence indicates clearer and more specific relationships between the main parts of the sentence. The word "before," for instance, tells readers that one thing occurs before another. A word such as "although" conveys a more complex relationship than a word such as "and" conveys.
The term periodic sentence is used to refer to a complex sentence beginning with a dependent clause and ending with an independent clause, as in "While he waited at the train station, Joe realized that the train was late."</p>
<br/><br/>
Periodic sentences can be especially effective because the completed thought occurs at the end of it, so the first part of the sentence can build up to the meaning that comes at the end.

<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b><center>What is Compound-Complex Sentences ?</center></b><br/>
<p align="justify">
The compound-complex sentence combines elements of compound and complex sentences. It is the most 
sophisticated type of sentence you can use. Understanding how to construct the compound-complex sentence 
will help you take your writing to a new level of complexity.<br/><br/>
</p>
<b>Understanding Clauses</b><br/>
A clause is comprised of at least one subject and one verb. There are two types of clauses: the independent 
clause and the dependent clause.<br/><br/>
<b>Independent Clause</b><br/>
An independent clause makes a statement or asks a question that can act as a complete sentence. <br/>
 Example: The dog barks. <br/><br/>
<b>Dependent Clause</b><br/>
A dependent clause cannot act as a complete sentence because it begins with a subordinating word, such 
 as when, because, if, whoever, etc.<br/><br/> 
 Example: When the dog barks. <br/> <br/>
All grammatically correct sentences have at least one independent clause, and, therefore, they have at least one 
subject and one verb.  <br/> <br/>
Identifying Compound and Complex Sentences <br/> <br/>
<b>The Compound Sentence</b><br/>
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, 
and, nor, but, or, yet, or so) and a comma or by a semicolon alone. <br/><br/>
Example: The pirate captain lost her treasure map, but she still found the 
 buried treasure<br/><br/><br/>
<b>The Complex Sentence </b><br/>
A complex sentence combines a dependent clause with an independent clause. When the dependent 
clause is placed before the independent clause, the two clauses are divided by a comma; otherwise, no 
punctuation is necessary.<br/><br/>
Example: Because the soup was too cold, I warmed it in the microwave. <br/><br/>
<b>Constructing Compound-Complex Sentences </b><br/>
A compound-complex sentence is comprised of at least two independent clauses and one or more dependent 
clauses. <br/><br/>
Example:<br/>
 Though Mitchell prefers watching romantic films, he rented the latest spy thriller, 
 and he enjoyed it very much. <br/><br/>
Example: <br/>
Laura forgot her friend's birthday, so she sent her a card when she finally 
 remembered. <br/><br/>
Because compound-complex sentences are normally longer than other sentences, it is very important to 
punctuate them correctly. Refer to your Commas 101 handout for tips on correct comma usage.<br/><br/>
