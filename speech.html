<div style="align: justify;"><b><font size="5%">What is noun?</b><br/></br>
<p align="justify">A noun is a part of speech that is used to name a person, place, thing, quality, or action.
A noun can function as a subject, object, complement, appositive, or object of a preposition.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Different types of nouns</b><br/><br/>

<b>1. Abstract noun </b>
- names an idea, event, quality, or concept (freedom, love, courage...) Concrete nouns name something recognizable through the sense (table, dog, house...)
<br/>
<br/>
<b>2. Animate noun</b>
- refer to a person, animal, or other creature (man, elephant, chicken...) An inanimate noun refers to a material object (stone, wood, table...)
<br/>
<br/>
<b>3. A collective noun</b> describes a group of things or people as a unit (family, flock, audience...)
<br/>
<br/>
<b>4. Common noun</b> 
- is the name of a group of similar things (table, book, window...) Proper nouns, however, refer to the name of a single person, place or thing (John, Joseph, London...)
<br/>
<br/>
<b>5. Compound noun</b> 
- refer to two or more nouns combined to form a single noun (sister-in-law, schoolboy, fruit juice)
<br/>
<br/>
<b>6. Countable (or count) noun</b>
- have a singular and a plural form. In plural, these nouns can be used with a number- they can be counted. (friends, chairs, houses, boys...) Uncountable (or non count) nouns, however, can only be used in singular. They can't be counted. (money, bread, water, coffee...)

<a href="speech.html" data-role="button" data-theme="a"><font size="5%">Pronoun</font></a><br/>
<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b>What is Pronoun?</b><br/><br/>
<p align="justify">Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns.
Every pronoun must have a clear antecedent (the word for which the pronoun stands).</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>KINDS OF PRONOUNS:</b><br/><br/> 

<b>A. Personal Pronouns: </b>   <br/>    
Personal pronouns have the following characteristics:
<br/><br/>          
1.  three persons (points of view)<br/>
     <br/>1st person - the one(s) speaking  (I  me my  mine  we  us our ours) 
      <br/>2nd person - the one(s) spoken to  (you your yours)
       <br/>3rd person - the one(s) spoken about  (he  him  his  she her hers  it  its  they  their  theirs)  
         </br></br>
          
2.  three genders</br>
       </br>feminine  (she  her  hers)
       </br>masculine (he  him  his)
       </br>neuter  (it its  they them their theirs) 
         </br></br>
           
 
3.  two numbers</br>
       </br>singular (I  me  my  mine  you  your  yours  he  him  his  she  her  hers it its)
       </br>plural  (we  us  our  ours  you  your yours  they  them  their  theirs) 
         </br></br>
           
 
4.  three cases </br>
     </br> subjective (I  you  he  she  it  we  they)
      </br>possessive  (my  mine  your  yours  his  her  hers  our  ours  their  theirs)
      </br>objective   (me  you  him  her  it  us  them)
         </br></br>
<b>B. Demonstrative Pronouns:</b></br></br>               
                   
Demonstrative pronouns can also be used as determiners.
</br>
                  
Example:</br>
</br>
            
Hand me that hammer. (that describes the noun hammer)</br>
 </br>                          
Demonstrative pronouns can also be used as qualifiers:</br>
</br>
           
Example:</br>
 </br>        
She wanted that much money? (that describes the adjective much)</br>
 </br>
                   
<b>C. Reflexive / Intensive Pronouns :  the "self" pronouns</b></br></br>
     
             
These pronouns can be used only to reflect or intensify a word already there in the sentence.</br>
 </br>             
Reflexive / intensive pronouns CANNOT REPLACE personal pronouns.</br>
  </br>                      
Examples:</br>
  </br>              
I saw myself  in the mirror. (Myself is a reflexive pronoun, reflecting the pronoun I.)</br>
   </br>             
I’ll do it myself. (Myself is an intensive pronoun, intensifying the pronoun I.)</br> 
  </br>                  
                    
Note:  The following words are substandard and should not be used:</br>
 </br>                         
           <center>  theirselves	|	   theirself	|  hisself     |    ourself</center></br>
 
 
                      
 </br>                   
<b>D. Indefinite Pronouns:</b></br></br>                      
Singular:</br>
 </br>
<center>
one	| someone |	anyone |	no one	| everyone</br>
each |	somebody |	anybody |	nobody	| everybody</br>
either	| something	|anything |	nothing	| everything</br>
 </center>      
  </br>                   
Examples:</br>
  </br>                           
Somebody is coming to dinner.</br>
Neither of us believes a word Harry says.</br></br></br>

 </br>
Plural Examples:</br>
</br>
Both are expected at the airport at the same time.</br>
Several have suggested canceling the meeting.</br></br></br>
Singular with non-countables / Plural with countables:</br></br>
 </br>
Examples:</br>
</br>
Some of the dirt has become a permanent part of the rug.</br>
Some of the trees have been weakened by the storm.</br></br>
Indefinite pronouns use apostrophes to indicate possessive case.</br></br>
Examples:</br></br>

The accident is nobody’s fault.</br>
How will the roadwork affect one's daily commute?</br>
Some indefinite pronouns may also be used as determiners.</br></br></br>
<center>one, each, either, neither, some, any, one, all, both, few, several, many, most</center></br></br></br>
Note the differences:</br></br>

Each person has a chance.</br>

(Each is a determiner describing person.)</br></br>


Each has a chance.</br>

(Each is an indefinite pronoun replacing a noun.)</br></br>


Both lawyers pled their cases well.</br>

(Both is a determiner describing  lawyers.)</br></br>


Both were in the room.</br>

(Both is an indefinite pronoun replacing a noun.)</br></br></br>

<b>E. Interrogative Pronouns:</b></br>
 
Interrogative pronouns produce information questions that require more than a “yes” or “no” answer.</br></br>
Examples:</br></br>

What do you want?</br>

Who is there?</br></br></br>
<b>F. Relative Pronouns:</b></br>
 
Relative pronouns introduce relative (adjectival) clauses.</br>

<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b>What is Verb?</b><br/><br/>
<p>
Verbs have traditionally been defined as words that show action or state of being.
</p>
</br>
<p align="justify">
Often, prefixes and suffixes (affixes)  will signify that a word is a verb.  
For example, the suffixes -ify, -ize, -ate, or -en usually signify that a word is a verb, as in typify, characterize, irrigate, and sweeten.  
Prefixes such as be-, de-, or en-  may signify that a word is a verb, as in bestow, dethrone, and encourage.  
These affixes, often inconsistent from verb to verb, are called derivational affixes. 
Added to a word, they either change the word's part of speech </p><br/><br/>
Example:<br/><br/>
embark means "to get on" (a ship , a plane, a journey)<br/>
dis +   embark -----> disembark means "to get off" (a ship, a plane)<br/></br/>

The base form of a verb is derived from the verb’s infinitive:  to	+  verb<br/></br/>
Example:<br/></br/>
to talk | to write | to buy<br/></br/>

Four suffixes consistently added to a verb’s base create all forms of a verb used in all tenses: <br/></br/>
1. -s   	creates 3rd person singular / present tense  (He talks.)<br/>
2. -ing   	creates the present participle / used with be  (He is talking.) <br/>
3. -ed   	creates the simple past  (He talked.)<br/>
4. -en        creates the past participle / used with have  (He has talked.) <br/><br/></br/>

Note:<br/></br/>
The -en verb ending used with a form of to have as an auxiliary is generally written -ed, as in has talked.
      <br/></br/>
Unlike the derivational affixes, these inflectional suffixes are consistently used with all verbs, even though their form may look different from verb to verb.<br/><br/>
Because many verbs in English are irregular; as result, their –ed and/or –en  endings may not follow any obvious pattern.<br/><br/>   <br/>
 
Examples:   <br/></br/>
(to write)	Smith writes short stories at home. (-s ending)   </br/><br/>
	Smith is writing short stories at home. (-ing ending)<br/>
	Smith wrote short stories at home. (-ed ending)<br/>
	Smith has written short stories at home. (-en ending)<br/>
	*<br/>
(to buy)	Jones buys a newspaper each day.  (-s ending)<br/><br/>
	Jones is buying a newspaper today.  (-ing ending)<br/>
	Jones bought a newspaper yesterday. (-ed ending)<br/>
	Jones has bought newspapers every day.  (-en ending)<br/>
	*<br/>
(to go)	Students go to the library often. (-s ending)<br/><br/>
	Students are going to the library often. (-ing ending)<br/>
	Students went to the library often. (-ed ending)<br/>
	Students have gone to the library often. (-en ending)<br/>
    <br/></br/>
The majority of verbs are regular and consistently use -ed and -en to form their simple past tense and past participles. (e.g. talked, has talked)
    <br/></br/>
Many verbs are irregular, however, and follow no consistent pattern in creating their -ed and/or -en forms.  A list of the major irregular verbs is shown below.

A verb phrase is defined as the main verb together with all its auxiliaries (helping verbs).<br/></br/>
Auxiliary verbs always precede the main verb.<br/></br/>
There are two types of auxiliary verbs:<br/></br/>
1. Inflected auxiliary verbs:
(be |	have |	do) <br/>
2. Modal auxiliaries (considered more fully under (auxiliary verbs)<br/>

Verbs may be divided into three types:<br/></br/>
A. Action verbs - show an action -- either physical or mental<br/></br/>
B.	Verbs of being (forms of be - is, are, was, were, has/have/had been, will be) - show a state of existence: <br/></br/> 
C.  **Linking verbs - link a subject with its complement <br/>
            (A subjective complement "completes" / "equals" the subject.)<br/>
            Linking verbs:  appear, taste, smell, feel, look, sound, grow, seem, remain,  <br/>

<div style="align: justify;"><font size="5%"><b>What is Adjectives?</b><br/><br/>
<p align="justify">
Traditionally, adjectives are defined as words that describe nouns or pronouns.  
When they describe nouns or pronouns, adjectives typically answer the following questions:</p>
</br>
<b><center>What kind?       Which one?       How many?</center></b>
<br/><br/>
For example, in the phrase
<br/><br/>
<b>TALL MAN</b><br/>
Tall is an adjective describing the noun man.<br/>
Tall answers the question "which man?" or "what kind of man?"<br/><br/>
Similarly, in the phrase,<br/><br/>
<b>EASY ASSIGNMENT</b><br/>
Easy is an adjective describing the noun assignment.<br/>  
Easy answers the question, "what kind of assignment?"<br/><br/>
Adjectives are usually placed before the nouns they describe, as in the examples, tall man and easy assignment, above.<br/><br/>
 
Thus, one may identify an adjective by using the following word-order test:<br/>
The ______ caught the bus.<br/><br/>
Adjectives may also follow the noun they describe.<br/><br/>
Example:<br/>
Smitherman , cold and achy , went to staright to bed<br/><br/>
Finally, adjectives may follow a verb of being or a linking verb, thus completing the noun subject <br/><br/>
Example:<br/>
Smitherman is cold and achy.<br/>
Smitherman feels cold and achy.
           <br/><br/>
Like nouns, adjectives are often recognizable by their suffixes.
<br/>
Endings such as  -ous   -ful  -ish  -able    usually designate adjectives.<br/><br/>
Example:
<br/>
Famous | Hopeful | Prudish | Personable<br/><br/>
<b>Comparative and superlative forms</b><br/>
 Single-syllable adjectives use -er and -est endings to designate comparative and superlative forms:
 tall---->taller---->tallest<br/><br/>
 Example:<br/>
 Charles is a tal man.
 James is taller than harry.(taller is comparative)<br/>
 Marvin is the tallest man in the room.(tallest is superlative)<br/><br/>
 Adjectives of two or more syllables use more and most for comparative and superlative forms.<br/>
 famous--->more famous--->most famous<br/><br/>
 Example:<br/>
 Jil is a famous explorer.<br/>
 Jen is more famous than Joy.(more famous is comporative)<br/>
 Jessa is most famous explore in the Planet.(most famous is superlative)<br/><br/>
 
 Note:<br/>
 	Two-syllable adjectives ending in -y may also use the -er / -est endings to designate comparative and superlative.<br/>
 lovely--->lovelier--->loveliest<br/><br/>
 Example: <br/>
This is lovely day. <br/>
This is a lovelier day than yesterday. (lovelier is comparative)<br/>
This is a loveliest day of the year. (loveliest is superlative)<br/><br/>
Note:  the following adjectives do not follow the regular rules for forming comparative and superlative forms: good, bad, little, ill.  <br/><br/>
To create negative comparative and superlative forms, use<br/>
 
less  for –er	and  	least for –est<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Adjective</th>
<th>Comparative Form</th>
<th>Superlative Form</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cold</td>
<td>less cold</td>
<td>least cold</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>careful</td>
<td>less careful</td>
<td>least careful</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>angry</td>
<td>less angry</td>
<td>least angry</td>
</tr>

<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b>What is Adverb?</b><br/><br/>
<p>
Adverbs are traditionally defined as words that describe verbs.
</p>
</br>
Adverbs answer any of the following questions about verbs:
<b><center>
how?    when?    where?     why?
</center></b>
<br/><br/>
The following examples illustrate adverbs modifying verbs: <br/>
Charles easilyliftd the barbell.<br/>
How did he lifted the barbell?<br/>
Easily is an adverb.<br/><br/>
We'll use the new software program tomorow.<br/>
When will we use it?<br/>
Tomorrow functions as an adverb.<br/><br/>
She hid the key nearby.<br/>
Where did she hide the key?<br/>
Nearby is an adverb.<br/><br/>
Adverbs are the most moveable of all parts of speech; therefore, 
it is sometimes difficult to identify an adverb on the basis of its position in a sentence.<br/><br/>
For example, <br/>the adverb slowly will fit into three places in the sentence 	He climbed the ladder:<br/><br/>
He climbed the ladder slowly.<br/>
Slowly he climbed the ladder.<br/>
He slowly climbed the ladder.<br/><br/>
Like adjectives of more than one syllable, adverbs usually become comparative and superlative by using more and most.
<br/><br/>
Examples:<br/>
Sam played the tune lyrically.<br/>
More played the tune <b>more lyrically</b> than Sam.(comparative)<br/>
Jack played the tune <b>most lyrically</b>.(superlative)<br/><br/>
<b>Flat Adverbs</b><br/><br/>
Adjectives that do not change form (add -ly) to become adverbs are called "flat adverbs."<br/><br/>
Typical flat adverbs are:<br/>
 <b>early, late, hard, fast, long, high, low, deep, near.</b><br/><br/>
To determine whether these words are functioning as adjectives or adverbs, one must determine<br/><br/>
                   
1)  what the word is describing (noun or verb)<br/>
2)  what question the word is answering</b><br/><br/>
 
The following examples illustrate the distinction.<br/><br/>
 <b>Early</b> as adjective<br/>
 The early train arrives at 8:45 a.m.<br/>
<i>Early</i> describes the noun train and answers the question "which one?"<br/><br/>

<b>Early</b> as adverb:<br/>
The 8:45 a.m train arrived early.
<br/>
<i>Early</i> describes the verb arrived and answers the question "when?"<br/><br/>

<b>Hard</b> as adjective:<br/>
The quarterback threw a hard pass to the receiver.<br/>
<i>Hard</i> describes the noun pass and answers the question "what kind?"<br/><br/>

<b>Hard</b> as adverb:<br/>
The quarterback threw the football hard.<br/>
<i>Hard</i> describes the verb threw and answers the question "how?"<br/>

<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b>What is Preposition?</b><br/><br/>
<p>
Prepositions are words which begin prepositional phrases.<br/>
</p>
</br>
A <b>prepositional phrase</b> is a group of words containing a preposition, 
a noun or pronoun object of the preposition, and any modifiers of the object.<br/><br/>

A preposition sits in front of (is “pre-positioned” before) its object.<br/><br/>
The following words are the most commonly used prepositions:<br/>
<br/>				
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>about</td>
<td>below</td>
<td>excepting</td>
<td>off</td>
<td>toward</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>above</td>
<td>beneath</td>
<td>for</td>
<td>on</td>
<td>under</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>across</td>
<td>beside(s)</td>
<td>from</td>
<td>onto</td>

It is useful to locate prepositional phrases in sentences since any noun or pronoun within 
the prepositional phrase must be the preposition’s object and, therefore, cannot be misidentified 
as a verb’s direct object<br/><br/>
<b>To the store</b> is a prepositional phrase.<br/>
<b>Store</b> is the object of the preposition to, not the direct object of the verb drove.<br/>
We drove our car to the store.<br/>
<b>Car</b> is the direct object of the verb <b>drove</b>.<br/>
<b>To the grocery store</b> is a prepositional phrase.<br/><br/>

NOTE:<br/>
A word that looks like a preposition but is actually part of a verb is called a particle.<br/><br/>
Example:<br/>
Four armed men <b>held up</b> the blank.<br/>
<b>Held up</b> is a verb meaning “to rob.”<br/>
Therefore, <i>up</i> is not a preposition, and <i>bank</i> is not the object of a preposition.<br/>
Instead, <b>bank </b>is the direct object of the verb <b>held up</b>.<br/><br/>
To avoid confusing prepositions with particles, test by moving the word (up) and words following it to the front of the sentence:<br/><br/>
<b>Up the bank</b> four armed men held<br/><br/>

If the resulting sentence does not make sense, then the word belongs with the verb and is a particle, not a preposition.<br/><br/>
Note the difference:<br/><br/>
Example A.<br/>
We ran up the hill.<br/>
Test. Up the hill we ran.<br/>
The resulting sentence makes sense.  Therefore, up is a preposition.<br/><br/>
Example A.<br/>
We ran up the bill.<br/>
Test. Up the bill we ran. XXX<br/>
The resulting sentence does not make sense. <br/>
Therefore, up is a particle in this sentence. <br/><br/>
The following examples illustrate the difference between prepositions and particles:<br/>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>He came by the office in a big  hurry.</td>
<td>(by=preposition)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He came by his fortune honestly.</td>
<td>(by=particle)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>She turned up that street.</td>
<td>(up=preposition)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>She turned up her nose.</td>
<td>(up=particle)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tom lived down the street.</td>
<td>(down=preposition)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We finally lived down that incident.</td>
<td>(down=particle)</td>
</tr>

<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b>What is Conjunction?</b><br/><br/>
<p align="justify">
Conjunctions are words used as joiners.
Different kinds of conjunctions join different kinds of grammatical structures.<br/>
</p>
</br>
The following are the <b>kinds of conjunctions:</b><br/><br/>
<b>A. COORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS</b> (FANBOYS)<br/>
<center><i>
for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so<br/><br/>
</i></center>
<b>Coordinating conjunctions</b> join equals to one another:<br/>
<b><center>
words to words,          phrases to phrases,          clauses to clauses.
</center></b><br/><br/>
Examples:<br/><br/>
<b>word to word</b> Most children like cookies and milk.<br/>
<b>phrase to phrase</b> The gold is hidden at the beach or by the lakeside.<br/>
<b>clause to clause</b> What you say and what you do are two different things.<br/>

Coordinating conjunctions usually form looser connections than other conjunctions do.<br/><br/>
Examples:<br/><br/>
Marge was late for work, <b>and</b> she received a cut in pay. (very loose)<br/>
Marge was late for work, <b>so</b> she received a cut in pay. (loose)<br/>
Because Marge was late for work , she received  a cut in pay .<br/><br/>
(The subordinate conjunction because creates a tighter link between  the two ideas.)<br/><br/>
Coordinating conjunctions go in between items joined, not at the beginning or end.<br/><br/>
Example:<br/><br/>
Correct: I like coffee, but I don't like tea<br/>
Incorrect: But I don't like tea, I like coffee.<br/><br/>

<b>Punctuation with coordinating conjunctions:</b><br/>
When a coordinating conjunction joins two words, phrases, 
or subordinate clauses, no comma should be placed before the conjunction.<br/><br/>
Example:<br/><br/>
<b>words:</b> cookies and milk<br/>
<b>phrase:</b> at the beach or by the lakeside.<br/>
<b>subordinate clause:</b> what you say nad what you do.<br/><br/>

A coordinating conjunction joining three or more words, phrases, 
or subordinate clauses creates a series and requires commas between the elements.<br/><br/>
Example:<br/><br/>
<b>words:</b> peanuts, cookies and milk<br/>
<b>phrase:</b> in the mountains, at the beach or by the lakeside.<br/>
<b>subordinate clause:</b> what you think, what you say nad what you do.<br/><br/>

A coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses creates a 
compound sentence and requires a comma before the coordinating conjunction<br/><br/>
Example:<br/><br/>
Tom ate all the peanuts, so Phil ate the cookies.<br/>
I don't care for the beach, but I enjoy  a good vacation in the mountains.<br/><br/>
<b>B. CORRELATIVE CONJUNCTIONS</b></b>
<center><b>
either. . .or	both. . . and
neither. . . nor	not only. . .  but also
 </b></center> </b></b>           
These pairs of conjunctions require equal (parallel) structures after each one.</b>  <br/>
<b>Faulty</b>: Clara not only wants money but also fame.<br/>
<b>Correct</b> Clara wants only money but also fame.<br/>
<b>Correct:</b> Clara not only wants money but also wants fame.<br/> <br/>
<b>C. CONJUNCTIVE ADVERBS</b><br/><br/>
These conjunctions join independent clauses together.<br/>
 The following are frequently used conjunctive adverbs:<br/><br/>
 <table border="1">
 <tr>
<td>after all </td>
<td>in addition</td>
<td>next</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>also </td>
<td>incidentally </td>
<td>nonetheless</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>as a result </td>
<td>indeed </td>
<td>on the contrary </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>besides </td>
<td>in fact </td>
<td>on the other hand </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>consequently </td>
<td>in other words </td>
<td>otherwise </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>finally </td>
<td>instead </td>
<td>still </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>for example  </td>
<td>likewise </td>
<td>then </td>
</tr>
</table><br/><br/>

<b>D. SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS</b><br/><br/>
These words are commonly used as subordinating conjunctions<br/><br/>

<table border="1">
 <tr>
<td>after </td>
<td>in order (that)</td>
<td>unless</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>although</td>
<td>insofar as</td>
<td>until</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>as</td>
<td>in that</td>
<td>when</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>as far as</td>
<td>lest</td>
<td>whenever </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>as soon as </td>
<td>no matter how</td>
<td>where</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>as if</td>
<td>now that</td>
<td>wherever</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>as though </td>
<td>once</td>
<td>whether</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>because</td>
<td>provided (that)</td>
<td>while</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>before</td>
<td>since</td>
<td>why</td>
</tr>
</table><br/><br/>

Subordinating conjunctions also join two clauses together,
 but in doing so, they make one clause dependent (or "subordinate") upon the other.

<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b><center>What is Interjection?</center></b><br/>
<p align="justify">
Interjections are words used to express strong feeling or sudden emotion. 
They are included in a sentence (usually at the start) to express a sentiment such as surprise, disgust, joy, excitement, or enthusiasm.
</p>
</br></br>
An interjection is not grammatically related to any other part of the sentence.</br></br>
Examples of interjections (shaded):</br>
•	Hey! Get off that floor!</br></br>

•	Oh, that is a surprise.</br></br>

•	Good! Now we can move on.</br></br>

•	Jeepers, that was close.</br></br>
<b>Yes and No</b></br>
Introductory expressions such as yes, no, indeed, and well are also classed as interjections.</br></br>
Examples:</br>
•	Indeed, this is not the first time the stand has collapsed.</br></br>

•	Yes, I do intend to cover the bet.</br></br>

•	I'm sure I don't know half the people who come to my house. Indeed, for all I hear, I shouldn't like to. (Oscar Wilde)</br></br>

•	Well, it's 1 a.m. Better go home and spend some quality time with the kids. (Homer Simpson)</br></br>

<b>Phew!</b></br>
Some interjections are sounds.</br></br>
Example:</br>
•	Phew! I am not trying that again.</br></br>

•	Humph! I knew that last week. </br></br>

•	Mmmm, my compliments to the chef.</br></br>

•	Ah! Don't say you agree with me. When people agree with me, I always feel that I must be wrong. (Oscar Wilde)</br></br>
