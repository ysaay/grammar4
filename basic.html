<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b><center>What is Fragments?</center></b><br/>
<p align="justify">
Every sentence has to have a subject and a verb in order to be complete (remember what we said about subjects and verbs?). 
If it doesn't, it's a fragment. That's easy enough if you have something like
</p>
</br>
1.	Ran into town. (no subject)</br>
2.	The growling dog. (no verb)</br></br>

Unfortunately, there's a little more to it than that. 
You can have a group of words with both a subject and a verb that is still a fragment. 
Not fair? What is? So, before we go any further, we need to cover some basics</br></br>

A phrase is nothing more than a group of words. (See prepositions.)</br></br>
A clause is a group of words with a subject and a verb. There are two types that you need to be able to distinguish:</br></br>
1.	main (independent) clause: one that can stand alone and express a complete thought</br>
2.	subordinate (dependent) clause: one that depends on another element for its complete meaning</br></br>

A main clause is a complete sentence; a subordinate clause, because it depends on something else, isn't--even though it has a subject and a verb.
A few examples should make this clear (subjects and verbs are bolded):</br></br>
1.	I sit in front of the fireplace.</br>
2.	We go for a walk.</br>
3.	I like people.</br></br>
These are all main clauses. The information might be sketchy, but the ideas are complete. Compare these with the following which are all subordinate clauses. 
There is a subject and a verb, but the ideas are incomplete.</br></br>
1.	When it is cold.</br>
2.	After the dishes are put up.</br>
3.	Who pat my head and give me treats.</br></br>
These are fragments because they are punctuated incorrectly. 
It's easy to spot this kind of mistake: just read your paper aloud, slowly and carefully, exactly as it is punctuated (that is, stop at each period).
If anything is incomplete (a fragment), you should hear it.</br></br>

Think about it: if I come into the room and haven't spoken to you, you'll be a little puzzled if all I say is "When it is cold." 
You're going to be waiting for more information. Actually, you'd probably be more than puzzled if I said anything!)</br></br>
One way to put these examples together clearly and correctly is:</br>
1.	When it is cold, I sit in front of the fireplace.</br>
2.	We go for walk after the dishes are put up.</br>
3.	I like people who pat my head and give me treats.</br></br>
Notice the punctuation. When a subordinate clause begins a sentence, always put acomma after it (#1). If the subordinate clause comes after the main clause, youusually need no punctuation (#2 and #3). 
With sentence 1 and 2, you could just as easily have written (again, pay attention to the punctuation):</br></br>
1.	I sit in front of the fireplace when it is cold.</br>
2.	After the dishes are put up, we go for a walk.</br></br>
Some of the words that create a subordinate clause are: after, although, as,because, before, if, since, that, unless, until, when, whether, which, while, and who.
 Watch out for these and check your sentences carefully to make sure they're punctuated correctly.</br></br>

<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b><center>What is Phrase?</center></b><br/>
<p align="justify">
A phrase is two or more words that do not contain the subject-verb pair necessary to form aclause. 
Phrases can be very short or quite long. Here are example</p>
</br>
After slithering down the stairs and across the road to scare nearly to death Mrs. Philpot busy pruning her rose bushes </br></br>

Certain phrases have specific names based on the type of word that begins or governs the word group: noun phrase, verb phrase, prepositional phrase, infinitive phrase, participle phrase,gerund phrase, and absolute phrase.</br></br>

<b>Noun Phrases</b></br>
A noun phrase includes a noun—a person, place, or thing—and the modifiers—either before or after—which distinguish it. The pattern looks like this:
OPTIONAL MODIFIER(S) + NOUN + OPTIONAL MODIFIER
</br></br>
Here are some examples:</br>
The shoplifted pair of jeans</br>
Pair = noun; the, shoplifted, of jeans = modifiers.</br></br>
A cat that refused to meow</br>
Cat = noun; a, that refused to meow = modifiers.</br></br>
A great English teacher</br>
Teacher = noun; a, great, English = modifiers.</br></br>
Noun phrases function as subjects, objects, and complements:</br></br>
The shoplifted pair of jeans caused Nathaniel so much guilt that he couldn't wear them.</br>
The shoplifted pair of jeans = subject.</br></br>
Jerome adopted a cat that refused to meow.</br>
A cat that refused to meow = direct object.</br></br>
With her love of Shakespeare and knowledge of grammar, Jasmine will someday be a great English teacher.</br>
A great English teacher = subject complement.</br></br>
<b>Verb Phrases</b></br>
Sometimes a sentence can communicate its meaning with a one-word verb. Other times, however, a sentence will use a verb phrase, a multi-word verb, to express more nuanced action or condition. A verb phrase can have up to four parts. The pattern looks like this:
AUXILIARY VERB(S) + MAIN VERB + VERB ENDING WHEN </br></br>
Here are some examples:</br>
Had cleaned</br>
Had = auxiliary verb; clean = main verb; ed = verb ending.</br></br>
Should have been writing</br>
Should, have, been = auxiliary verbs; write = main verb; ing = verb ending.</br></br>
Must wash</br>
Must = auxiliary verb; wash = main verb.</br></br>
Here are the verb phrases in action:</br>
Mom had just cleaned the refrigerator shelves when Lawrence knocked over the pitcher of orange juice.</br></br>
Sarah should have been writing her research essay, but she couldn't resist another short chapter in her Stephen King novel.</br></br>
If guests are coming for dinner, we must wash our smelly dog!</br></br> 	
<b>Prepositional Phrases</b></br> 
At the minimum, a prepositional phrase will begin with a preposition and end with anoun, pronoun, gerund, or clause, the "object" of the preposition.</br> </br> 
The object of the preposition will often have one or more modifiers to describe it. These are the patterns for a prepositional phrase: </br>
PREPOSITION + NOUN, PRONOUN, GERUND, OR CLAUSE </br>
PREPOSITION + MODIFIER(S) + NOUN, PRONOUN </br>

Here are some examples:</br>
On time</br>
On = preposition; time = noun.</br>.</br>
Underneath the sagging yellow couch.</br>
Underneath = preposition; the, sagging, yellow = modifiers; couch = noun..</br></br>
From eating too much</br>
From = preposition; eating = gerund; too, much = modifiers.</br></br>

<div style="align: justify;" ><font size="5%"><b><center>What is Clause?</center></b><br/>
<p align="justify">
Clauses come in four types: main [or independent], subordinate [or dependent], adjective [orrelative], and noun. 
Every clause has at least a subject and a verb. 
Other characteristics will help you distinguish one type of clause from another.<p>
</br>
<b>Main Clauses</b><br/>
Every main clause will follow this pattern:<br/>
SUBJECT + VERB = complete thought.<br/><br/>
Here are some examples<br/>
Lazy students whine.<br/>
Students = subject; whine = verb.<br/><br/>
Cola spilled over the glass and splashed onto the counter.<br/>
Cola = subject; spilled, splashed = verbs.<br/><br/>
My dog loves pizza crusts.<br/>
Dog = subject; loves = verb.<br/><br/>
The important point to remember is that every sentence must have at least one main clause. Otherwise, you have a fragment, a major error.<br/><br/>
<b>Subordinate Clauses</b><br/>
A subordinate clause will follow this pattern:<br/>
SUBORDINATE CONJUNCTION + SUBJECT + VERB = incomplete thought.<br/><br/><br/>
Here are some examples:<br/>
Whenever lazy students whine<br/>
Whenever = subordinate conjunction; students = subject; whine = verb.<br/><br/>
As cola spilled over the glass and splashed onto the counter<br/>
As = subordinate conjunction; cola = subject; spilled, splashed = verbs.<br/><br/>
Because my dog loves pizza crusts<br/>
Because = subordinate conjunction; dog = subject; loves = verb.<br/><br/>
The important point to remember about subordinate clauses is that they can never stand alone as complete sentences. 
To complete the thought, you must attach each subordinate clause to a main clause. Generally, the punctuation looks like this:<br/><br/>
Check out these revisions to the subordinate clauses above:<br/><br/>
Whenever lazy students whine, Mrs. Russell throws chalk erasers at their heads.<br/>
Anthony ran for the paper towels as cola spilled over the glass and splashed onto the counter.<br/>
Because my dog loves pizza crusts, he never barks at the deliveryman.<br/><br/>
<b>Relative Clauses</b><br/>
A relative clause will begin with a relative pronoun [such as who, whom, whose,which, or that] or a relative adverb [when, where, or why]. The patterns look like these:<br/><br/>
RELATIVE PRONOUN OR ADVERB + SUBJECT + VERB = incomplete thought.<br/>
RELATIVE PRONOUN AS SUBJECT + VERB = incomplete thought<br/><br/>
Here are some examples:<br/>
Whom Mrs. Russell hit in the head with a chalk eraser<br/>
Whom = relative pronoun; Mrs. Russell = subject; hit = verb.<br/><br/>
Where he chews and drools with great enthusiasm<br/>
Where = relative adverb; he = subject; chews, drools = verbs.<br/><br/>
That had spilled over the glass and splashed onto the counter<br/>
That = relative pronoun; had spilled, splashed = verbs.<br/><br/>
Who loves pizza crusts<br/>
Who = relative pronoun; loves = verb.<br/><br/>
Like subordinate clauses, relative clauses cannot stand alone as complete sentences.
 You must connect them to main clauses to finish the thought. Look at these revisions of the relative clauses above:<br/><br/>
 The lazy students whom Mrs. Russell hit in the head with a chalk eraser soon learned to keep their complaints to themselves.<br/><br/>
My dog Floyd, who loves pizza crusts, eats them under the kitchen table, where he chews and drools with great enthusiasm.<br/><br/>
Anthony ran to get paper towels for the cola that had spilled over the glass and splashed onto the counter.<br/><br/>
Punctuating relative clauses can be tricky. You have to decide if the relative clause isessential or nonessential and then use commas accordingly.<br/><br/>
<b>Essential relative clauses</b> do not require commas. A relative clause is essential when you need the information it provides. <br/>
Look at this example:<br/>
A dog that eats too much pizza will soon develop pepperoni breath.<br/><br/>
Dog is nonspecific. To know which dog we are talking about, we must have the information in the relative clause. Thus, the relative clause is essential and requires no commas.<br/><br/>
If, however, we revise dog and choose more specific words instead, the relative clause becomes nonessential and does require commas to separate it from the rest of the sentence. Read this revision:<br/><br/>
My dog Floyd, who eats too much pizza, has developed pepperoni breath.<br/><br/>
<b>Noun Clauses</b><br/>
Any clause that functions as a noun becomes a noun clause. <br/>
Look at this example:<br/>
You really do not want to know the ingredients in Aunt Nancy's stew.<br/>
Ingredients = noun.<br/>
If we replace the noun ingredients with a clause, we have a noun clause:<br/>
You really do not want to know what Aunt Nancy adds to her stew.<br/>
What Aunt Nancy adds to her stew = noun clause.<br/>
